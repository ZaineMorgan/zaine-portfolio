                    <p> HTML stands for “Hyper Text Markup Language” which is geek-speak for “a set of rules that tell computers
                        how to interpret code to display websites.”(seriously, there are literal sets of rules) HTML5 is
                        the 5th version of these rules, and brings major upgrades to the capabilities of websites. To oversimplify
                        the explanation, HTML5 is a convergence of several technologies currently used to make websites interactive.</p>

                    <p class="tname">CSS3</p>
                    <p> CSS allows you to separate your web sites HTML content from it’s style. As always you use your HTML file
                        to arrange the content, but all of the presentation (fonts, colors, background, borders, text formatting,
                        link effects and so on…) are accomplished within a CSS.</p>

                    <p class="tname">JAVASCRIPT</p>
                    <p> Javascript is an easy-to-use programming language that can be embedded in the header of your web pages.
                        It can enhance the dynamics and interactive features of your page by allowing you to perform calculations,
                        check forms, write interactive games, add special effects, customize graphics selections, create
                        security passwords and more.</p>

                    <p class="tname">PHP</p>
                    <p> PHP IS A powerful scripting language that fits gracefully into HTML and puts the tools for creating dynamic
                        websites in the hands of the people — even people like me who were too lazy to learn Perl scripting
                        and other complicated backend hoodoo.</p>

                    <p class="tname">LARAVEL</p>
                    <p> Laravel is one of the most demanding and famously used PHP web application framework. Having a feature
                        of developer friendliness, this framework brings a long list of advantages to their developers. A
                        developer can count on Laravel due to its ease of use, lesser coding and expressive syntax. This
                        open-source framework is used in the development of web applications and follows model-view-controller
                        (MVC) architectural pattern. Many development companies are turning towards Laravel development services
                        because of its high readability feature.

                    <p class="tname">GIT</p>
                    <p> Git is a "version control" system that that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that
                        you can recall specific versions later. For example if you are a graphic or web designer and want
                        to keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control
                        System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use. It allows you to revert files back to a previous state,
                        revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified
                        something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS
                        also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition,
                        you get all this for very little overhead.</p>
